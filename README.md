This is my refactored personal portfolio! 
For old code, refer to https://github.com/TheFrankWei/TheFrankWei.github.io---OLD (difference between the two is this one uses hooks for most components, still in the process of refactoring everything)

TODO:
-[] refactor UI for portfolio items
-[] add Website themes using Redux (?)
-[] add more cool animations
