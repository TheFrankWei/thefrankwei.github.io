Random QA:

Q: What's the reasoning behind my color choices for the hoverable letter titles?

A: I chose colors in a color triad, slightly altering some in order to fit WCAG AA large text standards


Q: Why does my code have some use of CSS elements (flexbox) while others are using Material UI (Grid)

A: I wanted to use Material UI but still display knowledge/utilization of HTML/CSS 

Q: What breakpoints are implemented for responsive design?

A: xs: 0,
   sm: 480,
   md: 768,
   lg: 992,
   xl: 1200
