        <p>Prompt:
          <br/>
          Little Einstein is a new online retailer of curated and innovative learning kits for kids. It was formerly a beloved shop in Park Slope Brooklyn that sold all types of DIY kits (both analog and digital), but the storefront was too expensive and the shop closed in 2012.  The owner wants to convert the store to online only and the owner (Alberta) now wants to focus her inventory on technology and electronics products geared towards kids ages 4 - 15. The primary goal for Little Einstein is to become the #1 resource for parents that want to incorporate hands on STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math, Art + Design) education into their childâ€™s everyday learning experience. The brand of Little Einstein celebrates learning while allowing kids to experiment and play with technology. The new online store will reflect the STEAM focused Philosophy of Littler Einstein by featuring new, innovative products, while at the same time maintaining a playful and creative vibe that was found in the store. The new website should inspire parents to spend money and feel like they made a good investment on a toy that will give the gift of learning.
          <br/>
          When beginning this project, our group wanted to focus on incorporating the personal experience customers originally had with Alberta, trying to find solutions in order to incorporate such interactions digitally. We used processes such as mind-mapping and card sorting in order to develop our ideas:

        <p>Next, we created a few user personas and a paper prototype in order to test our ideas:</p>

        <p>Through user feedback and testing, we created an improved interactive prototype:</p>
